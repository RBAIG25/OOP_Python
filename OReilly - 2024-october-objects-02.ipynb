    "Object-oriented programming is all about repackaging our code into units known as \"classes.\" Each class describes a new data structure that we define, along with the functionality that we'll want to implement on that data structure.\n",

    "### Some terms\n",
    "\n",
    "- A \"class,\" or a \"type,\" is the core idea in object-oriented programming. Each class is a factory for creating a different data type. In conversation, the words `class` and `type` are interchangeable. But in actual Python coding, we use the word `class` to define a new class, and we use the word `type` to find out what class something has. A class is an object in Python, an instance of the class known as `type`. (And yes, this is confusing...) When we want to solve a problem with objects, we map out what data structures we'll want, and we define those in our class definition.\n",
    "- An \"object\" is simple a value in the Python world. All values in Python are objects. Every object has a class that created it, its factory, or its type. We can find out an object's type by invoking `type(THE_THING)` on it. The value we get back will be a class object. Everything in Python is an object. "
