    "\n",
    "Back in the 1970s-1980s, computer scientists suggested that we approach things differently, combining into a single package the nouns and the verbs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The whole point of object-oriented programming is to make it easier to write, debug, and maintain our software.  By thinking of our software as a collection of nouns, each of which can perform certain tasks, get inputs from the outside world and send outputs to other objects, we can think at a higher level of abstraction, and thus write better software.\n",

    "The first object-oriented programming language was Smalltalk. Python isn't a direct descendant of Smalltalk, but we see some aspects of it in Python, including the idea that everything is an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "What do we get out of OO programming?\n",

    "- Consistency. Our objects and the system's objects that come with Python all work in the same way.  If you learn a new library/module, it will also work in the same way.\n",

    "- Abstraction. We don't need to think/worry about the details of the implementation in objects we're not currently modifying. We can think of them as a black box. Moreover, we don't have to think about lists, strings, tuples, and dicts -- we can think about high-level, real-world objects such as cars, people, desks, and companies.\n",

Python automatically sticks the newly created object at the head of the arguments passed to `__init__`. That first argument is assigned to the first parameter, which we traditionally call `self`.\n",

However, it's pretty rare to have an object that lacks any of its own attributes, so you're more likely than not going to define `__init_`."
