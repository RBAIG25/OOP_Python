    "\n",
    "Back in the 1970s-1980s, computer scientists suggested that we approach things differently, combining into a single package the nouns and the verbs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The whole point of object-oriented programming is to make it easier to write, debug, and maintain our software.  By thinking of our software as a collection of nouns, each of which can perform certain tasks, get inputs from the outside world and send outputs to other objects, we can think at a higher level of abstraction, and thus write better software.\n",

    "The first object-oriented programming language was Smalltalk. Python isn't a direct descendant of Smalltalk, but we see some aspects of it in Python, including the idea that everything is an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "What do we get out of OO programming?\n",

    "- Consistency. Our objects and the system's objects that come with Python all work in the same way.  If you learn a new library/module, it will also work in the same way.\n",

    "- Abstraction. We don't need to think/worry about the details of the implementation in objects we're not currently modifying. We can think of them as a black box. Moreover, we don't have to think about lists, strings, tuples, and dicts -- we can think about high-level, real-world objects such as cars, people, desks, and companies.\n",

    "\n",
    "In languages like C++ and Java, a class is a blueprint for creating a new object. Part of that blueprint includes a list of the fields (aka instance variables) that *will* be defined on each object of that type. You declare those fields in the class definition, and then you have to assign to them in one or more methods.\n",

    "Python works very differently. There is no way to declare fields in advance! The attributes (which are what we use for fields and instance variables) are assigned when the instance is created. If you create 10 instances, then the attributes will be created 10 times, once for each of the objects we create, as `__init__` is invoked.\n",

    "This is why it's so important for us to define all of our attributes in `__init__` -- not for technical reasons, but for maintenance and readability reasons. We want to be able to read a class, look at its `__init__`, and have a good sense of what attributes will be defined."
